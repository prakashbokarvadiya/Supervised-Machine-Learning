🔍 Project Overview

An end-to-end regression modeling project covering data understanding, cleaning, feature engineering, and model comparison using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

📊 Dataset Understanding

Loaded and inspected dataset structure

Identified feature types (numerical & categorical)

Defined target variable

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques

Detected and treated outliers

Encoded categorical variables

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions

Analyzed correlations between variables

Identified key patterns and relationships

🛠 Feature Engineering

Created new features (e.g., dosage-to-volume ratio)

Generated temperature bands and derived variables

🤖 Model Building

Linear Regression (baseline model)

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
